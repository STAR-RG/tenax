# tenax
Visualization tool to help people evaluate production of Brazilian researchers. 

The primary goal of tenax is to help decision makers at research committees to identify researchers that produce high-impact work. It does that by (1) using the database from csindexbr.org, which focuses on high-impact production and (2) presenting results with an intuitive user interface.
