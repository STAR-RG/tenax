# tenax
Visualization tool to help people evaluate production of Brazilian researchers. 

The primary goal of tenax is to help decision makers at research committees to identify researchers <i>that produce high-impact work</i>. 

It does that by (1) using the database from <a href="csindexbr.org">csindexbr</a>, which focuses on high-impact production and (2) presenting results with an intuitive user interface.
