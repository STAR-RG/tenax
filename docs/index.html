       <p>tenax is a simple visualization tool that tabulates the
       production of CS Brazilian researchers at highly-selective
       venues. The tool reports distinct metrics. By default, the list
       of researchers is sorted by the metric "# Top Papers", but you
       can choose any metric you like by selecting the corresponding
       column. Use the tool at your own discretion. The primary goal
       of tenax is to <i>give credit to researchers that produce
       high-impact work</i>. It does that by (1) using the databases
       from <a href="http://csindexbr.org/">csindexbr</a>
       and <a href="http://csrankings.org/">csrankings</a>, which
       focus on high-impact production and (2) presenting results with
       an intuitive user interface.</p>
