       <p>tenax is a tool to visualize the production of CS Brazilian
         researchers at highly-selective venues (since 2013). Click
         <a href="summary.html">here</a> if you want to visualize a
         summary of results (anonymized and grouped by CNPq
         level). The tabular view below provides more details. Use it
         at your own discretion. The primary goal of tenax is
         to <i>incentivize Brazilian researchers to publish at
         highly-selective venues</i>. This is important, for example,
         to increase international visibility of BR-CS research and to
         reduce cost. It is worth noting that tenax does <i>not</i>
         mine data and does <i>not</i> define custom metrics. tenax
         provides a visual interface for users to visualize the data
         from
         <a href="http://csindexbr.org/">csindexbr</a>. Interested
         users are advised to read the csindexbr
         <a href="https://csindexbr.org/faq.html">FAQ</a> to
         understand the venue selection criteria. To sum, csindexbr
         uses an objective criteria to categorize venues of each CS
         area in three tiers (shown in the table below). A fundamental
         principle of csindexbr is that the set of venues needs to be
         small, focused on high-quality venues. This enables, for
         example, experts to confirm that those venues are indeed the
         best in their fields.
