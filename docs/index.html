       <p>tenax is a tool to visualize the production of CS Brazilian
         researchers at highly-selective venues (since 2013). Click
         <a href="summary.html">here</a> if you want to visualize a
         summary of results (anonymized and grouped by CNPq
         level). The tabular view below provides more details. Use it
         at your own discretion. The primary goal of tenax is
         to <i>incentivize publication at highly-selective
         venues</i>. It does that by (1) using the database
         from <a href="http://csindexbr.org/">csindexbr</a>, which
         focuses on these venues and (2) presenting results with a
         very simple (hopefully, intuitive) user interface.</p>
