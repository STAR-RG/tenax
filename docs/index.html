       <p>Tenax is a tool to visualize the production of CS Brazilian
         researchers at highly-selective venues (since 2013). It uses
         <a href="https://csindexbr.org">csindexbr</a> data and CNPq
         data for that. Tenax does <i>not</i> mine data and
         does <i>not</i> define custom metrics. The primary goal of
         Tenax is to <i>incentivize Brazilian researchers to publish
         at highly-selective venues</i>. This is important, for
         example, to increase international visibility of BR-CS
         research, to reduce cost, and to raise credibility on our
         work. Interested users are advised to read the csindexbr
         <a href="https://csindexbr.org/faq.html">FAQ</a> to
         understand the venue selection criteria. For a summary of
         results (anonymized and grouped by CNPq levels), click
         <a href="summary.html">here</a>. The tabular view below provides more details. Use it
         at your own discretion.
